Part 2 - Reflection

Throughout this whole quarter, in this lab, I have learend how to sign in to my ieng6 account and also learned how to access java files through vim. Something technical or cool I learned from this lab was the part when we had the change to use git add and git push commands in order to make changes in our github files.
